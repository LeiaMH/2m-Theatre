    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <h3>2mTheatre was founded to create socially-distanced performances during the coronavirus pandemic.</h3>
    <p>Our aim is to bring theatre to communal spaces and garden squares so that people can enjoy a live performance without having to leave their own neighbourhood. The pandemic has meant that it is difficult for theatres to operate safely - so rather than asking people to travel and gather in large crowds, we are bringing the theatre to them. By performing outdoors in communal spaces, we are able to provide safe, socially-distanced theatre, where the audience can watch in household groups while enjoying picnics alongside their neighbours at a safe distance of 2m.</p>
    <p>One of the most positive aspects of the coronavirus crisis has been that people have begun to appreciate their local area, families and neighbours more. By providing a shared theatrical experience in a communal area, we can bring communities closer together. We want young children, adults and old people to come together and share the same experience. By performing in non-traditional venues, we also hope to engage people who would not normally go to the theatre, as well as dedicated audiences.</p>
    <p>We are a troupe of six young professional performers – musicians, actors and an opera singer. As we witnessed our industry become decimated by the lockdown, we came together to find a way to rebuild and reinvent live performance for the new normal. The unique experience of live performance has always had an essential role to play in human society. Through theatre, we gain connection - we gain perspective - we gain compassion - but we lose ourselves. We need theatre now more than ever, and so we bring you 2mTheatre.</p>
